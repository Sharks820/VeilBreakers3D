# LEGACY GODOT DOCUMENTATION

> **WARNING: These files are from the Godot 2D project (deprecated)**
>
> VeilBreakers has transitioned to **Unity 3D**. These documents are kept for reference only.

## Why These Files Are Here

These documents reference:
- GDScript code patterns
- Godot 4.x-specific systems
- The old 12-brand system (now 10-brand)
- 2D sprite-based development

## DO NOT USE

New Claude sessions should:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `VEILBREAKERS.md` in project root
2. Use Unity C# patterns (documented in VEILBREAKERS.md)
3. Ignore these legacy files unless doing a specific historical lookup
